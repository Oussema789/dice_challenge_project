# dicee_challenge_project

To get some casino vibes, I named this project "Las Vegas Dice Challenge." The game's rules are straightforward. It is founded on a simple probability event.
You have two dice, and you get points whenever their faces have the same number.
You will receive +3 points if the number is a pair.
Otherwise, you will be penalized with a -1 point.

The following features have been implemented:
Every time the dice faces change, you must press the play button.
You can check your score by clicking on the "Check your score" button.
You can play the game once more.
You have the option to exit the application.


Here's who the app works:
